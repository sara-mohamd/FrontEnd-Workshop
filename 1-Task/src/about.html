      Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user
      experience aspects of website development rather than software development.
      Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers. However, since the mid-2010s, design for
      mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.
      A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for
      instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information
      is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group
      and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity,
      so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone
      of a web designerâ€™s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target
      audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.
